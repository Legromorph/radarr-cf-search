# üé¨ Polishrr

This Python script automatically identifies and upgrades movies and TV episodes in **Radarr** and **Sonarr** based on their **Custom Format Scores**.  

It helps you keep your media library at the highest possible quality ‚Äî without manual effort.

---

## üöÄ How It Works

### üîπ Radarr
- The script fetches all movies from your Radarr library.  
- For each movie, it checks:
  - Is the movie **monitored**?  
  - Does it have an existing **file**?  
  - Is its **custom format score** below the required `cutoffFormatScore`?  
- If so, the movie is marked for upgrade and a **search command** is triggered in Radarr.  
- Movies that already have the **upgrade tag** (default: `upgrade-cf`) are **skipped**.  
- Once **all movies** are tagged, the script removes the tag from every movie ‚Äî restarting the upgrade cycle.

### üîπ Sonarr
- Works similarly to Radarr, but on the **episode** level:  
  - Episodes with a lower quality score than required are tagged and queued for search.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The script reads all settings from a `.env` file (expected path: `/config/.env`).

Example configuration:

```env
# General settings
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
UPGRADE_TAG=upgrade-cf

# Radarr
PROCESS_RADARR=true
RADARR_URL=http://localhost:7878
RADARR_API_KEY=your_radarr_api_key
NUM_MOVIES_TO_UPGRADE=2

# Sonarr
PROCESS_SONARR=true
SONARR_URL=http://localhost:8989
SONARR_API_KEY=your_sonarr_api_key
NUM_EPISODES_TO_UPGRADE=3
```

## üß© Process Overview

1. Load all environment variables.  
2. Ensure the upgrade tag (`UPGRADE_TAG`) exists in Radarr/Sonarr.  
3. Identify all upgrade candidates (below cutoff score).  
4. Randomly select a few and mark them with the upgrade tag.  
5. Trigger search commands to fetch better versions.  
6. Skip already tagged items.  
7. If **everything** is tagged ‚Üí remove all tags ‚Üí restart cycle.

## ü™µ Logging

All events are logged to `/config/output_YYYY-MM-DD.log`.  
Example log output:

```
2025-10-07 14:23:12 [INFO] Starting Radarr upgrade process
2025-10-07 14:23:12 [INFO] Tagged movie 'Inception' with 'upgrade-cf'
2025-10-07 14:23:12 [INFO] Triggered Radarr search command.
```


You can adjust the log level via the `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable (e.g. `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`).

## üê≥ Docker installation

You can run **Polishrr** using Docker with the following configuration:

```yaml
services:
  polishrr:
    image: ghcr.io/legromorph/polishrr:latest
    container_name: polishrr
    environment:
      - CRON_SCHEDULE=0 * * * *   # default: run at every full hour
      - TZ=America/Los_Angeles    # set your desired timezone
    volumes:
      - /path/to/config:/config   # place your .env file here
```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run the Script

# Automatic Run

The script runs automatically based on the **CRON_SCHEDULE** environment variable.

Default: 0 * * * * ‚Üí runs every full hour

You can customize this value to any valid cron expression.

# Manual Run

If you want to run the script manually inside the container:
```bash
docker exec -it polishrr python app.py
```

Or, if running locally:
```bash
python app.py
```

By default, both Radarr and Sonarr processes run:
```python
run_radarr_upgrade()
run_sonarr_upgrade()
```

To disable one, modify your .env:
```env
PROCESS_RADARR=true
PROCESS_SONARR=false
```

## üñ•Ô∏è Planned Feature: Web Interface

A **web interface** is planned to make the tool more user-friendly.  
It will allow you to:

- View real-time upgrade status  
- Start or pause processes manually  
- Browse logs and quality statistics
